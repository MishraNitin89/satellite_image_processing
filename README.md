This is a repository for Computer Vision Course Project for Land Use and Urban Planning via Satellite Image Processing: Enhancement, Classification, and Segmentation Using CNNs and Transfer Learning

This project explores the application of computer vision techniques for land-use classification, semantic segmentation, and image enhancement. Using the EuroSAT dataset, transfer models such as EfficientNetB0, VGG16, ResNet50, and a custom CNN were fine-tuned and trained for high-accuracy classification. Furthermore, the LandCover.ai dataset was utilized to develop a U-Net-based segmentation model, leveraging pre-trained feature extraction layers. After the evaluations using pre-trained models, we also derived a Confusion Matrix as well as the Grad-CAM Heat Map to indicate which regions of the image are most influential in making a prediction. Additionally, pre-trained generative models were implemented for image enhancement tasks, including denoising, super-resolution, colorization, and inpainting. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning models in land-use analysis and image enhancement, achieving over 98% accuracy in classification and robust segmentation and enhancement capabilities for practical applications.
